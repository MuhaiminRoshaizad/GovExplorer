# GovExplorer

> A React Native playground for exploring Malaysia's open data APIs.

Built with **React Native (Expo) + TypeScript**, GovExplorer is my first React Native app — a hands-on project to learn the framework while playing with the public datasets from [data.gov.my](https://data.gov.my/) and [developer.data.gov.my](https://developer.data.gov.my/).

> 🇲🇾 Coming from Flutter, treating this as a sandbox to figure out what the gov APIs expose and what kinds of screens make sense to build around them.

_Coming soon — once the first screens are built._

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** LTS (22.x recommended) — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Expo Go** app on your phone — [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) / [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
- _(optional)_ Android Studio if you want to run on an emulator instead of a physical device

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhaiminRoshaizad/GovExplorer.git
cd GovExplorer
npm install
```

### Running the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

Then either:

- **On phone** — open Expo Go and scan the QR code printed in the terminal (phone and PC must be on the same Wi-Fi)
- **Android emulator** — press `a` in the terminal
- **Web** — press `w` in the terminal

Edit any file under `app/` or `src/` and save — the app reloads instantly via Fast Refresh.

## 📚 Data Sources

Primary source is the Malaysian Government Open Data portal, with two complementary public APIs for daily-frequency data:

| Source | Base URL | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| data.gov.my | `https://api.data.gov.my` | Catalogue datasets (fuel, CPI, population, AQI, dams, etc.) |
| Bank Negara Malaysia | `https://api.bnm.gov.my/public` | Exchange rates |
| METMalaysia | `https://api.met.gov.my/v2.1` | Weather forecasts |

- **Browse datasets** → [data.gov.my/data-catalogue](https://data.gov.my/data-catalogue)
- **API docs** → [developer.data.gov.my](https://developer.data.gov.my/)
